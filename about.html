        <h1> Hey, I am Madeleine.</h1>
        <h2> I am a UX researcher passionate about you. Especially those of you who aren’t always at the top of a designer’s mind. </h2>
        <img class="me" src="selfportrait.jpg" alt="self portrait">
        <p>
            I never knew how much design impacted my life until I was diagnosed with a genetic, connective tissue disorder. The simplest tasks, such as opening a can of marinara sauce, became nearly impossible without the use of accessible products. <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            As a UX Research Intern, I was tasked to identify opportunities to expand access for disabled students for online learning. My personal experiences coupled with a degree in Cognitive Science, allowed me to provide a unique and missing perspective on the project.
        </p>    
        <p>
            I am committed to making accessibility mainstream; often challenging myself and others to examine how we can design accessible products without sacrificing aesthetics or simplicity.
        </p>
        <p>
            These days, you will often find me inventing new features for applications or discussing usability improvements with unsuspecting (and unwilling) strangers. <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            I am always excited to learn new things or collaborate on projects that inspire me. Check out my resume, <a class="linked" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mbatespatton/">LinkedIn</a>, or simply drop a message below!
