                                It can be overwhelming for anyone to acclimate to a workplace. Adding a language barrier makes the process even more strenuous. This app began with the question: How might we help non-native English speakers quickly learn industry terms without getting stressed out <br>
                                First, we conducted user interviews and disseminated a survey to better understand the user base

                        <h2>Interview Insights</h2>
                            <p>
                                In a series of intimate, 1:1 interviews, we found that non-native English speakers: <br>

                        1. Feel <b>pressure</b> to be updated on idioms and industry terms <br>

                        2. Often <b>worry</b> about using incorrect grammar or mispronouncing words <br>

                        3. Need a <b>quick</b> way to brush up on specific terminology 
                            </p>
                        <h2>Survey Insights</h2>

                                Of the 18 participants, we learned: <br>

                    <b>75%</b> of participants classified themselves as <i>proficient</i> English speakers <u>yet</u> <b>75%</b> of them expressed insecurities emerging in presentations, networking, and 1:1 conversations <br>

                    Overall, <b>53% </b>desired to improve their professional language skills

                                In the realm of language-learning applications, there were a lot of competitors— at first glance. I conducted an in-depth analysis of each company’s offered features to determine their strengths and weaknesses. For each competitor, I stepped through the onboarding process, completed various milestones (when available), and took notes of my overall experience and impressions. Below are some highlights from the analysis:

                            <p>
                                All lack one essential feature: <b>curriculum customization.</b> Similarly, most of the applications help users learn general vocabulary and phrases, <i>not</i> colloquialisms which are often a source of insecurity for non-native English speakers. 
                    <b>buzzword</b> has a leading competitive edge as it has a simple interface that anyone can learn, no expensive or locked content, and covers industry-specific terms that the user can select and update at any time
